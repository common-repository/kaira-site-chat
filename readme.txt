[Site Chat](https://wpsitechat.com/go/home/) is a simple, intuitive site chat box which sends messages from your website to your WhatsApp or WhatsApp Business phone number.

Offering WhatsApp support builds trust with your users by offering them private chat support and lets you easily and professionally engage with visitor and generate new leads or sales on your store.

Site Chat adds a customizable WhatsApp button to the bottom right (or left) of your website, where users can click to open a WhatsApp style chat box and easily ask any questions they may have... With Site Chat, you can add multiple WhatsApp contacts or agents for sales, technical support and more... Add the agents name, WhatsApp number, work position and even avatars... Users can then select who they'd like to chat to on WhatsApp and then easily start chatting.

Site Chat for WhatsApp also integrates with WooCommerce, letting your site visitors easily enquire about your products over WhatsApp.
